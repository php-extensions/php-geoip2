/**
 * Model class for the data returned by GeoIP2 Enterprise database lookups.
 *
 * The only difference between the City and Enterprise model classes is which
 * fields in each record may be populated. See
 * http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/web-services more details.
 *
 * @property-read \GeoIp2\Record\City $city City data for the requested IP
 * address.
 * @property-read \GeoIp2\Record\Continent $continent Continent data for the
 * requested IP address.
 * @property-read \GeoIp2\Record\Country $country Country data for the requested
 * IP address. This object represents the country where MaxMind believes the
 * end user is located.
 * @property-read \GeoIp2\Record\Location $location Location data for the
 * requested IP address.
 * @property-read \GeoIp2\Record\MaxMind $maxmind Data related to your MaxMind
 * account.
 * @property-read \GeoIp2\Record\Country $registeredCountry Registered country
 * data for the requested IP address. This record represents the country
 * where the ISP has registered a given IP block and may differ from the
 * user's country.
 * @property-read \GeoIp2\Record\RepresentedCountry $representedCountry
 * Represented country data for the requested IP address. The represented
 * country is used for things like military bases. It is only present when
 * the represented country differs from the country.
 * @property-read array $subdivisions An array of {@link \GeoIp2\Record\Subdivision}
 * objects representing the country subdivisions for the requested IP
 * address. The number and type of subdivisions varies by country, but a
 * subdivision is typically a state, province, county, etc. Subdivisions
 * are ordered from most general (largest) to most specific (smallest).
 * If the response did not contain any subdivisions, this method returns
 * an empty array.
 * @property-read \GeoIp2\Record\Subdivision $mostSpecificSubdivision An  object
 * representing the most specific subdivision returned. If the response
 * did not contain any subdivisions, this method returns an empty
 * {@link \GeoIp2\Record\Subdivision} object.
 * @property-read \GeoIp2\Record\Traits $traits Data for the traits of the
 * requested IP address.
